# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

Install dependencies
```shell
bun install
```

Build (compile) contracts.
```shell
bun run build
```

Test
```shell
bun run test
bun run test-store
bun run test-domain
bun run test-root
```
